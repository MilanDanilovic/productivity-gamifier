# Icon Instructions

To complete the PWA setup, you need to create icon files:

1. **icon-192.png** - 192x192 pixels
2. **icon-512.png** - 512x512 pixels

## Quick Generation Options:

1. **Online Tools:**
   - Visit https://www.favicon-generator.org/
   - Upload a square image (at least 512x512)
   - Download the generated icons

2. **Design Software:**
   - Create icons with retro game styling
   - Use emoji or pixel art style
   - Suggested design: ⚔️ sword icon or 🎮 game controller

3. **Temporary Solution:**
   - Use any 192x192 and 512x512 PNG images
   - The app will work without proper icons, but won't look as polished

## Icon Design Suggestions:
- Retro pixel art style
- Green color scheme (matching primary color #22c55e)
- Game-related symbols (sword, shield, controller, etc.)
- Simple, recognizable design that works at small sizes
